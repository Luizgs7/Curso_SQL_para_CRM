# SQL for CRM

Course I developed to disseminate the use of SQL to analyze customer data in the company where I work. In the course we learned about everything from the basics of SQL to advanced queries in an applied way, to create customer segmentation (Life Cycle and Frequency and Value), generation of strategic KPI's and creation and segmented marketing campaigns.
